Click the "Sort" button on the top right to sort! (There's sound too)<br>
Use the selector to change which sorting algorithm is used.<br>
Use the slider to adjust how many items you're sorting. (But be warned... you will get an alert if you try to sort too large a dataset with an inefficient sorting algorithm.)<br>
You can change the display to be colored bars (default), just the colors, or just the bars.<br>
If you want to, you can further customize the display by flipping it to vertical or adjusting the gradient used.<br>
<h3>About</h3>
The algorithms are all implemented by me, although none of them are my invention (I came up with anytime quicksort independently but I'm sure it already exists).<br>
Mergesort is displayed as if it were an in-place sort to highlight the process of merging, but in practical uses it would be implemented with auxillary memory instead of as visualized.<br>
