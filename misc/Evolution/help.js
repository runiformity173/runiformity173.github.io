You can individually adjust whether the simulation should be fast or not and whether mutations are enabled.<br>
While <strong>Fast Mode</strong> is enabled, the creatures can evolve much faster (in real time) because the simulation is accelerated. However, this makes it difficult to see what the creatures are actually doing, which is why you can turn it off to get a better look.<br>
While <strong>Mutations</strong> are enabled, surviving creatures have a chance to mutate their genes when they reproduce. While this is enabled, creatures can adapt and improve. However, most mutations will just make the individual creature worse and not survive.<br>
You can also change the <strong>Survival Condition</strong> to decide how creatures survive and, therefore, what they adapt towards.<br>
Check the <strong>Survival Overlay</strong> checkbox to see in which areas creatures will survive (for location-dependent survival conditions).<br>`;
