const helpText = `Set "Filter" to something to only display categories in that filter.
Select a category to generate in "Category".
Select a level of the category in "Challenge Rating".
'0-4','5-10','11-16', and '17-20' for non-dragon hoards.
'Wyrmling', 'Young', 'Adult', and 'Ancient' for dragon hoards.
Press "Roll!" to get an output of the encounter or treasure.

If it doesn't work, reload. Make sure that your "Challenge Rating" value isn't a dragon value for a non-dragon category, and vice versa.`;
