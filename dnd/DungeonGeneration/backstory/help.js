const helpText = `Input the character's "Race", "Background", "Class", and "Charisma Mod" (modifier).
You can leave any one of them to 'Random' if you don't have that information.
If any one of your required inputs isn't listed, other is an option.
"Generate" gives information about the character.

The fields that have class and background names are the reasons why you are those things.`;
