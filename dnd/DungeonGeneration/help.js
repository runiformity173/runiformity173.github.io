const helpText = `"Height" and "Width" determine how big the dungeon can get, as well as the resolution.
"Dungeon Type" is used for theming the rooms.
"Remove Dead Ends" removes corriders that lead to nowhere when checked.
"Floor Color" and "Wall Color" let you change the color of the corridors and the background, respectively.
"Apply Display Changes" keeps the current dungeon layout, but applies the "Remove Dead Ends" and color settings.
"Generate" generates whatever is selected. 'Furnishings' and 'Dressings' both have setting selection within them.
"Generate Dungeon" will generate a dungeon with the current settings.

Once generated, a 'Location' and 'Creators' give some general information.
Click on a room to get information about it in the side panel.
The information gives:
    What's in the room for the players
    Appearance in the 'Details' section
    Exit direction and type (if any) in the 'Exits' section
The dungeon is an image, if you want to save it.`;
